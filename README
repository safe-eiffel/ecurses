eCurses is an Eiffel binding to *Curses.
Whit this library it is possible to write nice console applications with
features like scrolling, cursor positioning, various character attributes,
color, windows.

This version of eCurses has been developed and tested with

    * ISE Eiffel version 4.3 (Linux or Windows)
    * Linux	  : NCURSES 4.2
      Windows     : PDCurses 2.4


*** Installation

.1 Unpack directory structure
-----------------------------
Simply extract the tarball. Directory structure is described below :

+ base 		-- base Curses abstractions.
|
+ doc		-- Documentation in various formats
|
+ spec 		-- API and constants wrapping classes.
| |
| + Clib 	-- c source files.
| |
| + linux 	-- linux specific files.
| |
| + windows 	-- windows specific file.s
|
+ utility 	-- some classes found useful to develop eCurses applications
|            	   like an event manager and a frame panel.
|
+ test 		-- small test projects.
  |
  + hello 	-- hello world !
  |
  + pad 	-- exercise basic pad capabilities.
  |
  + slk 	-- exercise soft label keys.
  |
  + curses 	-- mimics the 'ncurses' standard test application.

.2 Get the appropriate Curses library
-------------------------------------
Get and install the appropriate Curses library.

* NCURSES Version 4.2. http://www.gnu.org. Work on Unix/Linux platforms.

* PDCurses Version 2.4. http://www.lightlink.com/hessling. Works on Windows
9X and Windows NT. PDCurses also offer an X11 implementation for Unix,
but it has not been tested with the ECurses library.
!!WARNING : PDCurses has to be patched. Please refer to the documentation.

.3 Compile support library
--------------------------
C files are in the spec/Clib directory. The spec/<platform> directory
contains ad hoc makefiles.

windows A makefile (Makefile.vc.mak) is provided for MSVC compiler.
Library name is ecurses_c.lib.

linux  A makefile (Makefile) is provided for Linux .  Type "make all"
in order to build the library libecurses_c.a.

This support library is necessary to compile and link eCurses programs .
